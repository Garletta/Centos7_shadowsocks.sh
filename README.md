# Centos7_shadowsocks.sh
This is the installation and configuration script of shadowsocks-python under Centos7 x86_64

Update on 2018-05-17 23:57  
On Centos-7-x86_64-bbr, some machine can't install pip by command: yum install python-pip, so I modify the origal command to slove this problem.  
If you use bandwagonhost and Centos7x86_64-bbr,you can download the script Centos7_ss.sh  
The script will help you to deploy shadowsocks server and your firewalld  
You just need to input the server_port and password, which you want to deploy your shadowsocks service
